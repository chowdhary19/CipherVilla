## Overview
This project is a comprehensive course designed to teach you how to build a full-featured real estate marketplace using the MERN stack. You'll learn to create advanced authentication mechanisms, implement real-world CRUD operations, and deploy the app using the 'render' platform.

## Key Features
- **Advanced Authentication**: Implement JWT, Firebase, and Google OAuth for secure and seamless user access.
- **Real-world CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete property listings using MongoDB.
- **User-friendly Features**: Enhance the user experience with image uploads, property listing management, and more.
- **Advanced Search Functionality**: Implement cutting-edge search features to help users find what they're looking for.
- **Deployment Made Easy**: Learn to deploy your MERN real estate app for free using the 'render' platform.

## Installation
To install the necessary libraries and start the project, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sahandghavidel/mern-real-estate-app.git
cd mern-real-estate-app
```

### Install Dependencies
#### Backend
```sh
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Frontend
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following:
```sh
MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB URI>
JWT_SECRET=<Your JWT Secret>
FIREBASE_API_KEY=<Your Firebase API Key>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<Your Google OAuth Client ID>
```

## Running the Application
### Backend
```sh
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Frontend
```sh
cd frontend
npm start
```

## Prerequisites
A basic understanding of JavaScript and React is recommended. This course is ideal for aspiring full-stack developers, React enthusiasts, or anyone eager to expand their web development toolkit.

## What You'll Learn
- Implementing advanced authentication using JWT, Firebase, and Google OAuth.
- Building robust CRUD operations for property listings.
- Enhancing user experience with features like image uploads and property management.
- Developing advanced search functionality.
- Deploying the application using the 'render' platform.

## Example Code Snippets
### Backend: JWT Authentication Middleware
```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const auth = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.header('x-auth-token');
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ msg: 'No token, authorization denied' });

  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (e) {
    res.status(400).json({ msg: 'Token is not valid' });
  }
};

module.exports = auth;
```

### Frontend: Redux Action for Property Listing
```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
import { GET_PROPERTIES, PROPERTY_ERROR } from './types';

export const getProperties = () => async dispatch => {
  try {
    const res = await axios.get('/api/properties');
    dispatch({
      type: GET_PROPERTIES,
      payload: res.data,
    });
  } catch (err) {
    dispatch({
      type: PROPERTY_ERROR,
      payload: { msg: err.response.statusText, status: err.response.status },
    });
  }
};
```
